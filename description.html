        <h1>What is this Club?</h1>
      </div>
      <p class="lead">The CS(Computer Science Club) is a club for learning computer science. In this club, you will be introduced to the world of Computer Science, including but not limited to programming. Amity Regional High School actually offers an AP Computer Science course. In fact, many people in this club had taken or are taking this course.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>We will usually meet on Wednesdays after school unless an
announcement is made ahead of time via the Facebook group. If you don't have a Facebook account, I
strongly suggest you create an account as Facebook is the easiest way to communicate for the club. That
being said, please add me (Scott Gusciora) and send a message asking to join the group so I can include
you in the group. Chances are there will not be further communications through email after this. Also, if you
know someone who is interested in the club but did not receive this email, then share this with them
</p>

      <h3>What is Computer Science?</h3>
