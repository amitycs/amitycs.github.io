                <h3 class="panel-heading">Do I need to know how to program already?</h3>
                  <p class="panel-body">No, but if you don't then you need to be somewhat motivated to learn. While programming isn't hard, it certainly isn't easy. You need to be willing to  learn and a lot of this club is do-it-yourself. We give you the tools to figure stuff out for yourself.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Are we going to learn how to “hack”?</h3>

              <p>According to Webster, “hack” has the following definitions:</p>

              <ul>
                  <li class="alert alert-success">a : to write computer programs for enjoyment</li>
                  <li class="alert alert-danger">b : to gain access to a computer illegally</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We will be doing a, not b.</p>

              <hr/>

              <h3>What tools do we use?</h3>

              <p>Whatever you want. So far the club has used:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><code>PHP</code> for Web Development</li>
                      <li><code>Java</code> for some applications</li>
                      <li><code>Java</code> for Android</li>
                      <li><code>Xcode + Objective C</code> for iPhone apps</li>
                      <li><code>Java+Eclipse+Mercurial</code> for GE Case Study</li>
                  </ul>

              <p> It's easy to learn if you've used anything else (Netbeans,
                  Visual Studio, …) and we'll be glad to provide direction.
              </p>

              <hr/>

              <h3>Are we going to learn how to make video games?</h3>

              <p>Maybe. You choose the projects you do. However, bear in mind that making video games is not
                an easy task whatsoever. If you have no programming experience yet then it is unlikely you will be
                capable of making anything more advanced than, say, Minesweeper by the end of the year. Perhaps a
                2d-sidescroller like Super Mario Brothers. You will not be able to make the next 3d shoot-em-up game.
              </p>

              <h3>What competitions do we participate in?</h3>
              <p>This year we will likely compete in the GE Computer Science Competition (both the case
                  study and the test-if they have it this year), the Quinnipiac Computer Programming Competition, and
                  anything else that might seem interesting. Information will be available ahead of time for those that
                  want to participate. Depending on how many members are interested in participating in the
                  competitions, spaces will be prioritized for those who have completed or are taking Mr. Barretta's AP
                  Computer Science class. 
                  Here are links to some information:
                </p>

                <ul>
                   <li><a href="http://www.ge.com/gecomputerscience/">http://www.ge.com/gecomputerscience/</a></li>
                   <li>Quinnipiac</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Do I need to bring anything?</h3>
                <p>If you have a laptop that'd be great for you because IT keeps wiping all our settings and so we
                have to reinstall everything a lot. And if you use your laptop then you can do stuff from home when
                you feel motivated. We do have computers though if that's inconvenient
                </p>

                <h3>Where/when do we meet?</h3>
                <p class="alert alert-warning">As of now, we meet in Ms Loman's CAD room. Room 157. Wednesdays.</p>

                <h3>What does Robotics do? I might be interested in that instead.</h3>

                  <p>Robotics competes in the VEX Robotics Competition every year. The competition this year is
                  outlined here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ-5H3JVtPs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ-5H3JVtPs</a>. Robotics meets Tuesdays and might
                  be a good alternative if CS is too “nerdy” for you or you are more interested in hardware than
                  programming. There are many members who do both which would be awesome.
